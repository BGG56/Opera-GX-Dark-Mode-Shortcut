This extension copies the origin (main URL) of the currently opened website and then opens Opera GX's Force Dark Mode exceptions page.
This makes it more convenient to disable Force Dark Mode for specific sites that don't display correctly.

Originally, I intended for the extension to automatically add the site to the exceptions list.
However, I couldn't find a way to programmatically add new entries to the list that stores exceptions.



To install extension download repo, then in opera gx open extensions (ctrl+shift+e), press load unpacked and find the repo's folder.
